If you have new ideas about sbt or an open-ended discussion, please use https://github.com/sbt/sbt/discussions instead of posting them to the issue tracker, which we use to track bugs and (internal) todo list.

Please note that sbt is mostly maintained by community effort, so one of the questions that we'd ask might be "would like to contribute it if we help you where the relevant code is".
